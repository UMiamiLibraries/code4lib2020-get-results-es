You should get an output like the one below depending on your operating system. . git version 2.25.0.windows.1 . If you don&#39;t have Git installed, please refer to the following documentation to install it on your computer: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git . Docker and Docker-Composer setup . In this workshop, you will need to have Docker and Docker-Composer installed on your computer. Please follow the below installation instructions from the Docker official documentation, for the operating system you are running. . Docker for Mac | Docker for Windows 10 (Pro, Enterprise, or Education) | Docker for Ubuntu | . To verify Docker is installed correctly, please run the following command on a terminal: . $ docker run hello-world . This command should output the following: . Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon. 2. The Docker daemon pulled the &quot;hello-world&quot; image from the Docker Hub. (amd64) 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading. 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal. To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with: $ docker run -it ubuntu bash Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID: https://hub.docker.com/ For more examples and ideas, visit: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/ . You should also verify docker-compose is intalled. Please run the following command in a terminal: . $ docker-compose --version . Depending on the version of docker-compose you have installed, the output should look like this: . $ docker-compose version 1.25.0, build 0a186604 . Increase memory for Docker . For this workshop, we need to increase the amount of memory that Docker can use in the host computer. A limit of 4096 MB should be enough. . For hosts running Mac . Open Docker settings. | Select the Advanced tab. | Increase the memory limit to 4096 MB. | Docker for Mac Advanced Settings. . . For hosts running Windows . Open Docker settings. | Select the Advanced tab. | Increase the memory limit to 4096 MB. | Docker for Windows Advanced Settings. . . For hosts running Ubuntu . Open a terminal and run the following command: | sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=4096000 . . Congratulations! Now you should have Docker and Docker-compose installed on your computer. In the next sections, we will go through the steps for creating a Dockerfile. . Previous: Welcome! Next: Project Setup .",

    "title": "Creating the Dockerfile",
    "content": "Creating the Dockerfile . A Dockerfile contains all the commands needed to build a specific image. Think off a Dockerfile as a recipe to build an image. . Docker images are formed by multiple read-only layers that are representations of the instructions contained in the Dockerfile. Each layer builds on top of the previous layer. . Let&#39;s create a new file named Dockerfile in the .docker directory and add the following code to it. . #.docker/Dockerfile FROM appsvc/php:7.3-apache_20200101.1 . . We are instructing Docker to start FROM the pre-existing PHP and Apache image built by Microsoft, appsvc/php:7.3-apache_20200101.1. This pre-existing image is running a Linux distribution and php version 7.3 and apache, and it was created on January 1st, 2020. . Now, let&#39;s install composer. Add the following code to the Dockerfile. . #.docker/Dockerfile RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php RUN mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer &amp;&amp; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/composer &amp;&amp; composer --version . . The pre-existing image that we are using comes with PHP Opcache enabled. This extension helps to improve PHP performance by caching scripts in memory. However, since we are going to be using this container for development purposes, we want to disable caching for now. In order to do that, let&#39;s insert the following code into our Dockerfile. . #.docker/Dockerfile #Remove php opcache file -- only for development RUN rm -rf /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/opcache-recommended.ini . . Synchronizing spin-up of independent containers . In this workshop we are going to have multiple containers running at the same time. However, we might run into a scenario where our development container depends on another container to work, and not only another container, but also the services running inside this other container to be up and running. . To address this problem, we are going to use wait-for-it, a bash script that will make our development container wait for any other container it depends on to continue. Add the following code to your Dockerfile: . #.docker/Dockerfile COPY ./wait-for-it/wait-for-it.sh /usr/local/wait-for-it.sh RUN chmod u+x /usr/local/wait-for-it.sh . . We also need to tell Docker that the container is going to be listening on a specific port at runtime. Please add the following code to the Dockerfile: . #.docker/Dockerfile EXPOSE 80 . . Our container will be listening to requests on port 80 . Adding an ENTRYPOINT to the Dockerfile . An ENTRYPOINT will let us specify which commands we want to execute when the container is started. Let&#39;s, for now, add the following code to our Dockerfile . #.docker/Dockerfile COPY ./.docker/init.sh /usr/local/bin/init.sh RUN chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/init.sh ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/usr/local/bin/init.sh&quot;] . . The previous code will copy the init.sh file into the Docker container and define an ENTRYPOINT using the init.sh But wait, the init.sh file does not exist. Let&#39;s create an init.sh file in the .docker directory and add the following code to it: . #!/usr/bin/env bash echo &quot;Checking Elasticsearch node 1 is ready&quot; /usr/local/wait-for-it.sh esnode-1.local:9200 -s --timeout=120 -- echo &quot;Node 1 is ready!&quot; echo &quot;Checking Elasticsearch node 2 is ready&quot; /usr/local/wait-for-it.sh esnode2-1.local:9200 -s --timeout=120 -- echo &quot;Node 2 is ready!&quot; # start apache sed -i &quot;s/{PORT}/80/g&quot; /etc/apache2/apache2.conf /usr/sbin/apache2ctl -D FOREGROUND . . This code will wait 2 minutes for the Elasticsearch containers (we will create these in a later section) to be ready and then starts up the Apache server listening on port 80. . The Dockerfile should look like this at this point: . FROM appsvc/php:7.2-apache_20191031.7 RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php RUN mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer &amp;&amp; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/composer &amp;&amp; composer --version #Remove php opcache file -- only for development RUN rm -rf /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/opcache-recommended.ini COPY ./.docker/init.sh /usr/local/bin/init.sh RUN chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/init.sh ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/usr/local/bin/init.sh&quot;] . . Time to build the container. Run the following code from the project root folder in a console: . $ docker build -f .docker/Dockerfile . . . The previous command tells Docker to build a container using the Dockerfile defined in the -f parameter. I f you don&#39;t specify a filepath, Docker will search for a Dockefile within the same directory the build command is executed from. The dot at the end of the command specified the location where we want to build the container. In this case, we are building the container in the current directory . The output from the previous docker build command should look similar to this: . Sending build context to Docker daemon 286.2kB Step 1/7 : FROM appsvc/php:7.2-apache_20191031.7 &gt; 692faef99277 Step 2/7 : RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php &gt; Running in 59de52d7babe Cannot load Zend OPcache - it was already loaded All settings correct for using Composer Downloading...

So far we have written a Dockerfile to build a Docker container running PHP, Apache, php-composer and a custom ENTRYPOINT. In the next sections, we will create a docker-compose file to configure other containers that we need for our search application. . . Previous: Project Setup Next: The docker-compose file .",
