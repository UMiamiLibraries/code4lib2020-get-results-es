Please follow the below installation instructions from the Docker official documentation, for the operating system you are running. . Docker for Mac | Docker for Windows 10 (Pro, Enterprise, or Education) | Docker for Ubuntu | . To verify Docker is installed correctly, please run the following command on a terminal: . $ docker run hello-world . This command should output the following: . Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon. 2. The Docker daemon pulled the &quot;hello-world&quot; image from the Docker Hub. (amd64) 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading. 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal. To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with: $ docker run -it ubuntu bash Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID: https://hub.docker.com/ For more examples and ideas, visit: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/ . You should also verify docker-compose is intalled. Please run the following command in a terminal: . $ docker-compose --version . Depending on the version of docker-compose you have installed, the output should look like this: . $ docker-compose version 1.25.0, build 0a186604 . Increase memory for Docker . For this workshop, we need to increase the amount of memory that Docker can use in the host computer. A limit of 4096 MB should be enough. . For hosts running Mac .
